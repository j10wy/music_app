	<h1>The Pretender</h1>
	<h3>Foo Fighters</h3>
		<p>
			<br>
			Keep you in the dark 
			<br>
			You know they all pretend 
			<br>
			Keep you in the dark
			<br>
			And so it all began 
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<br>
			Send in your skeletons
			<br>
			Sing as their bones go marching in, again
			<br>
			The need you buried deep
			<br>
			The secrets that you keep are ever ready
			<br>
			Are you ready?
			<br>
			I'm finished making sense
			<br>
			Done pleading ignorance
			<br>
			That whole defense
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Spinning infinity, boy
			<br>
			The wheel is spinning me
			<br>
			It's never-ending, never-ending
			<br>
			Same old story
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			What if I say I'm not like the others?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
			<br>
			You're the pretender
			<br>
			What if I say I will never surrender?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not like the others?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
			<br>
			You're the pretender
			<br>
			What if I say that I'll never surrender?
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			In time our soul untold
			<br>
			I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
			<br>
			The page is out of print
			<br>
			We are not permanent
			<br>
			We're temporary, temporary
			<br>
			Same old story
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			What if I say I'm not like the others?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
			<br>
			You're the pretender
			<br>
			What if I say that I'll never surrender?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not like the others?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
			<br>
			You're the pretender
			<br>
			What if I say that I'll never surrender?
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm the voice inside your head
			<br>
			You refuse to hear
			<br>
			I'm the face that you have to face
			<br>
			Mirrored in your stare
			<br>
			I'm what's left, I'm what's right
			<br>
			I'm the enemy
			<br>
			I'm the hand that will take you down
			<br>
			Bring you to your knees
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			So who are you?
			<br>
			Yeah, who are you?
			<br>
			Yeah, who are you?
			<br>
			Yeah, who are you?
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep you in the dark
			<br>
			You know they all pretend
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			What if I say I'm not like the others?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
			<br>
			You're the pretender
			<br>
			What if I say I will never surrender?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not like the others?
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
			<br>
			You're the pretender
			<br>
			What if I say that I'll never surrender?
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			What if I say I'm not like the others?
			<br>
			(Keep you in the dark)
			<br>
			What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
			<br>
			(You know they all pretend)
			<br>
			You're the pretender
			<br>
			(Who dares)
			<br>
			What if I say I will never surrender?
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			What if I say I'm not like the others?

		<p>
			So who are you?
			<br>
			Yeah, who are you?
			<br>
			Yeah, who are you?

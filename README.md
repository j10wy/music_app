# Music On Project Outline

### Description

Our APP is called Music On: an all in one platform where you can find lyrics to your favorite songs allowing you to sing a long to the tracks.

### Motivation

Listening to music on Spotify is something I like to do on a daily basis, but when I want to learn a song or sing along it does not provide lyrics on their web app just mobile. Meaning I have to search in another browser what the lyrics are or go to youtube to search for a video that shows the lyrics.

### Results

Using the Music Mix and Spotify APIs we were able to develop an all in one application where you can play your choice of song and view the lyrics at the same time. 

### Team Effort
All: Overall vision for app
Front End Team: Patrick 
Back End Team: Jeff/Kaylynn

### Individual Responsibilities:
Patrick: Front End html/css code

Jeff: Backend Spotify API (using Firebase)
- Local Host
- Spotify token/firebase 

Kaylynn: Backend MusicMix API
- Getting the key 
- Setting up AJAX call
- Dealing with JSONP data 
- Displaying API data to the html (cleaned lyrics by splitting, got album cover and album name from Spotify)

Kaylynn/Jeff: Backend logic of parsing and extracting what data we wanted to use. 

### Challenges

- Spotify API (Firebase/token), getting around using the song or artist ID
- MusicMix API using JSONP data format
- Modal

### Improvements
- With money we could get full access to API for musicMix allowing us to provide full lyrics and different translations.

- Addition of providing guitar chords.

- Adding in a search parameter on lyrics page in the nav bar
